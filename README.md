This is my basic setup for Gnu/Emacs.

The init.el is commented. The only other things included are the elpa packages used:
- modes: elixir, html, vue and scss (and dependent packages for those)
- usability: smex, mmm

It's pretty basic, I did it exactly from scratch in order to only include what I really needed and I have found it covers most of my use cases even at this minimal setup
To use it, just replace your .emacs.d folder with the contents of this one.
